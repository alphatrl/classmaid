# Contributing to SMU-Shortcuts

We want to make this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's

- Reporting a bug

- Submitting a fix

- Proposing new features

In addition, for SMU students who are not developers, there is [Google Forms](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScgqpbGEKOSj-1eNTfo5wBoewE7bEFhhWCGcFjygrV1zSN_Iw/viewform) to do the same thing.

## Developing with Github

We used Github to host code, track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`
1. Make sure your code lints
1. Issue that pull request

## MIT Software License

When you submit your code, your submissions will be under the same [MIT License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project.

## Report bugs using Github Issues

We used Github issues to track public bugs Report a new bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/fourthclasshonours/smu-shortcuts/issues).

## Writing a Bug Report

Good Bug Reports tend to have:

- A quick summary/background of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific
  - Give sample code if you can
  - Your Operating System
  - Your browser
- What are your expected results
- What actually happens
- Notes (e.g. Why you think this is happening, stuff you tried but did not work)

Having a detailed bug reports help us replicate the issue on our side.

## Use a consistent coding style
